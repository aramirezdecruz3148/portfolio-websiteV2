      <h2>Hello There!</h2>
      <p>I am Full-Stack Software Developer and Professional Creative 
        with a background as an artist and arts administrator. My time 
        in the arts has primed my tech career with empathy, drive and a 
        love for dynamic collaboration.
        As a queer woman of color I am extremely passionate about diversity
        within the tech community and creating applications that are accessible
        and can speak across divides.
      </p>
